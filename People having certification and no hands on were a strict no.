People having certification and no hands on were a strict no.


There is only one answer NO.

It will work against you , its way way better if you try to build something in aws and 
write about that and tell upfront in the interview that you dont believe in cramming objects questions .
You did hands on and show some gitcode.
I bet u will have way way better cahnces than certification people.
